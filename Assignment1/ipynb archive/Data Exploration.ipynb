I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!\\n\\nA simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. \\n\\nI also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! \\n\\nI'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.\",\n",

    "## 3.2.3 Writing Styles\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion points based on the formality of the way of writing, proper use of English sentence structure such as good grammar, proper pronouns, capitalization, and terms used in the posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Overflow\n",
    "Stack Overflow has a relatively less formal way of writing. Informal words like \"Doesn't, I'm, I've...\" are more prevalent that its counterpart. In general, we could observe decent use of English and sentence structure. However, that could be better. In many posts, the start of their sentences and bullet points are not capitalised. Moreover, usage of some words are incorrect e.g. Conjunctions used in the post body \"So I can filter them out...\" or \"And now we see that using ...\". It is worth noting that there are technical terms and codes used in Stack Overflow that could be Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) words. For example, tree_.__getstate__() and graphviz' .dot file are used in the posts but the words are OOV. Therefore, tokenization need to be altered to account for unknown tokens (UNKs). Similarly, we should use a software-specific POS tagger to handle the text from Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Zone\n",
    "Hardware Zone has two main components - news and forums. The news portion is similar to Channel NewsAsia as most of the news are retrieved from proper news websites, our group will be focusing on the forums. The forums are filled with informal way of writing. The users are mainly Singaporeans, which can explain the common use of Singlish, improper English and structure. On one of the posts - 'any reviews for their boxes? like streams always buffering??', we can observe the lack of capitalisation, use of broken English and exccessive use of punctuation. For another post, it utilised Singlish - 'Change to dark mode lor'. There is also frequent use of emojis or expressions in many posts. Hence, the terms used could be less complex in Hardware Zone as there is very little complex technical terms and unique words used as compared to Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel NewsAsia\n",
    "Channel NewsAsia is a news platform. The journalists are proficient in English and there are many layers of vetting before a post is published. On that account, Channel NewsAsia has a formal way of writing, the most proper use of English sentence structure as compared to the other two counterparts. The posts have proper punctuations and sentence structures. Each sentence is gramatically correct, has capitalisation at the start and proper nouns are capitalised. There might be some unknown terms used such as 'Oxbotica' or 'AppliedEV' but with proper sentence structures, there is enough context to understand. Out of all 3  websites, it would be the easiest to apply tokenization and POS tagging directly to this news posts.\n",

       "   'text': 'I really want to like this place but every time I go there it gets worse and worse with every visit.  Recently I went to get breakfast after church and after a 15 minute wait for a table which was expected I noticed other tables were crossed off their \"wait list\" that came in after us.  I get it that they would like to sit 4 people at a 4 person table but I really do not want to wait until one of their little 2 person tables opens up so we can be jammed into it.  Once again, I get it... I do not expect to be put at a 6 or 8 person table because that would be weird for 2 people.\\n\\nAfter being seated we waited 5-10 minutes for a waitress to stop and take our drink order which she brought promptly back but would return to take our breakfast order.  Fast forward 25-30 minutes (I eventually put a timer on my phone as I was getting aggravated) another waitress stopped by and told us that there must have been a mix up.  We ordered 4 over easy eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and toast.  Fast forward a second time for another 30 minutes; we have not been checked on, I ran out of coffee, and the table seated at the same time we were had received their food, ate, and were signing their bill.  After the strenuous feat of flagging down the waitress that took our order but was not her table, we asked for a bill for the coffee and told her we were leaving because we had a prior obligation we needed to attend.  She seamed very put off that after spending over an hour to attempt to order 4 eggs (only half cooked so it should have been easier), a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast; she told us \"its fine, don\\'t worry about the coffee bill\".  And no apology offered.\\n\\nBut seriously...  This is average breakfast food.  4 eggs, a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast???  Why didn\\'t that just take it off of the buffet?  We could see giant piles of this in their roasters.  But then again it would have been $15 per person if it came from the buffet.\\n\\nThis is the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant without eating.',\n",

       "   'text': 'On July 10, 2015, my family and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast. I found the perk-cup cafe online and thought it would be great to try a new place for breakfast. The place was pretty empty and we still waited for a seat...it took a long time for our waitress to even make an initial visit. We have two daughters and the one is two years old so things can get hectic at times. Our two year old daughter had peed herself in her pull-up diaper. The seat got wet so I quickly rushed to the bathroom and retrieved paper towels. While I cleaned the seat and placed our daughter on paper towels the waitress finally showed up and asked what we needed for drink. Meanwhile my wife said to save from any further embarrassment we should wait after we place the order to take her to the car to change her. Thinking it should be quick for the waitress to return with our drinks and to take our order we started to get uncomfortable when she took a while. Our thought was that she noticed the accident and was talking about it to the other staff. When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said \"I wouldn\\'t want to sit in that seat after that.\" Instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents, she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident. She was more consigned about the chair than offering to assist with this embarrassing moment. The mess was cleaned off of the vinyl chair and I had placed paper towels until my wife went to the car for another pull-up diaper. I then asked for the manager and she was also the owner, at first she sided with the waitress. After hearing my side she said that she will talk to the waitress about the incident. My wife and I took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama. We are both educated professionals and also manage people for a living, after seeing so many infractions on this visit, it was determined that we will not be visiting this establishment ever again. After reading other negative  postings and one about their two year old child that had to sit on his father\\'s lap for breakfast due to lack of service, obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant. What a let down. We did however went to another restaurant in downtown Olmsted falls, the waitress was delighted to assist our family! She was very polite and gave attention to our kids! What a difference it was and we were generous with the a 40% gratuity tip. We are people that usually give compliments to assure good service and it takes a lot for us to give negative feedback. Please reconsider this place if you are looking for breakfast as a family with kids. Business need to realize that all the customer wants is good service and to be understood when needing assistance. I really hope the staff and owner gets training in customer service.',\n",

       "   'text': 'On July 10, 2015, my family and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast. I found the perk-cup cafe online and thought it would be great to try a new place for breakfast. The place was pretty empty and we still waited for a seat...it took a long time for our waitress to even make an initial visit. We have two daughters and the one is two years old so things can get hectic at times. Our two year old daughter had peed herself in her pull-up diaper. The seat got wet so I quickly rushed to the bathroom and retrieved paper towels. While I cleaned the seat and placed our daughter on paper towels the waitress finally showed up and asked what we needed for drink. Meanwhile my wife said to save from any further embarrassment we should wait after we place the order to take her to the car to change her. Thinking it should be quick for the waitress to return with our drinks and to take our order we started to get uncomfortable when she took a while. Our thought was that she noticed the accident and was talking about it to the other staff. When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said \"I wouldn\\'t want to sit in that seat after that.\" Instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents, she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident. She was more consigned about the chair than offering to assist with this embarrassing moment. The mess was cleaned off of the vinyl chair and I had placed paper towels until my wife went to the car for another pull-up diaper. I then asked for the manager and she was also the owner, at first she sided with the waitress. After hearing my side she said that she will talk to the waitress about the incident. My wife and I took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama.

I ordered eggs Benedict , and biscuits and gravy. My wife got bourbon peach French toast. First off ( in my best Donald Trump voice) the portions were YUGE!!. Sadly the eggs Benedict was a flavorless mess. It was not played well, just kind of slopped all over the plate with a watery absolutely flavorless yellow something I would not even recognize as hollandaise sauce on top. The biscuit gravy was delicious but when brought out had that not so nice under the  heat lamp  too long crust on it. Had our server ever come back around to say, refill our coffee, or ask about our food I would have returned it. The biscuits were obviously store bought mush. My wife's only response was meh. Obviously canned peaches and just okay. One and done.\",\n",

We literally \\nstood there for a good 5 min waiting before we finally sat down and our waitress finally came over and asked if we needed anything and I said yes we need a highchair and they were still supposedly looking for one. She brought over another chair and I looked at her and I said my daughter is 2 that is not going to work. She did apologize but offered us no other alternative. We were finally offered coffee and some beverages a good 10 minutes after we got there. Our service overall was subpar. My daughter had to sit on my husband's lap or my lap because we never did get a highchair!!!! After over an hour I did see that I highchair finally became available and they never even offered to see if we needed it at that point! It overall seem like they were overstaffed and completely unprepared for the amount of people although I know that they've had Father's Day and Mother's Day brunch is before so it's not like they didn't know that this amount of people were going to be there!

The Garden Vegetable Baker was a good size portion of eggs, veggies, cheese, and hash brown with a side of toast.\\n\\nIf you're work on your patience, please visit.

After today, we will probably not be going back.  Though it really wasn't that busy, it took just over half an hour to get served.  Dishes were coming out of the kitchen about eight minutes apart, and when ours was finally brought out, we asked the waitress if there was only one cook in the kitchen, and she said, no, there were two, but one of them was new.  Poor planning on their part means we were sitting there hungry for way too long.  It is very clean and bright, but very wide open and not very cozy.  The food is passable, so if you don't mind mediocre food and slow service, this is the place for you.

The service is relatively slow, although not impolite.  The slowness is clearly evident from the ordering process through the table service.  So my conclusion of Perk Cup is to either go for a sit-down breakfast, brunch or lunch time.  Due to its recent opening, lunch time is not very busy during the weekdays.\\n\\nFood menu at Perk Cup, offers breakfast sandwiches, other standard breakfast items like Granola, Yoghurt.  the coffee selection are the standard 4 or 5 flavors for a breakfast stop.  For lunch crowd the items choices include Salads to light standard cold or panini sandwiches.  The food items and quality are nothing to 'write home about', they are the standard tasting.  Perk Cup does not seem to offer any niche or specialty items when it comes to food. \\n\\nIf you are located in or visiting Berea,  and need a spacious and un-crowded place for a breakfast or lunch meeting, Perk Cup might just be a good consideration.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"We came here because this is the only breakfast place within 10 minutes of the airport, where our friend was staying. I was expecting an empty place, but surprisingly, a lot of people there on a Sunday morning at 9:45am. \\n\\nFood wise, it is your standard breakfast fare. Lunch was also served in the early morning as well. My bf got the chicken salad - had a bite, our clinic cafeteria made better chicken salad sandwiches with more flavor. It came with a side of chips. Nothing special, not worth paying $8 for it. I ordered the Sweet and Savory platter. Three small slices of bacon - on the plus side, they were not very greasy. Two eggs over easy - eggs were well done, but they are just eggs... Didn't appreciate the french toast and the eggs on the same plate, since it just made the egg yolk run over to the french toast, ketchup mixed with maple syrup, etc. Had the extra blackberry brandy sauce on the side for the french toast. I think the maple syrup tasted better. The sauce was on the sour side, not what I was expecting... \\n\\nService... now this is where they get bumped from 3 stars down to 2. The whole place was full, so it was fine waiting 10-15 minutes for a table. However, when we got down to ordering, we ended up waiting almost 30 min for our food. This is very very simple and standard food. I cannot comprehend how 2 dishes of 2 eggs, bacon, french toast, and a chicken salad wrap could have taken that long... even if there was a whole dining room full. Should still have not taken that long. We did not get checked on once during our meal, except for like 1 minute after we got the food, before we even started eating, the waitress came by to ask us how we liked the food. After that, it took us 10 minutes to get a waitress to bring us our checks, and then another 10 minutes for them to bring the credit cards back. Overall, what should have been a 1 hour long breakfast got extended out to 2 hours. Ridiculous.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Second time here and 1st trying the Sunday brunch buffet. We arrived around noon and it was busy, but there appeared to be many open tables so we put our name in thinking it would go fast. About 1/2 later and 25 or so \"I\\'m hungry\\'s\" from the kids, our name was called. We told the lady who sat us that we wanted the buffet and she mumbled someone would be with us soon to get our order. Finally after about 5 minutes I sent my wife and kids up to get food and waited to \"place our order\" for buffets. The waitress came by and was sweet as pie and took our drink order and explained what was on the buffet. Looking around, she was the ONLY waitress who had a smile on her face and looked like she wanted to be alive that day. Onto the food... they have a great spread including made-to-order omelets, fresh waffles, bacon, sausage, french toast, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy, fruit, muffins and dessert. The older gentleman who was making the eggs and waffles was amazing and put on a show for my daughter who wanted to go back up for seconds on her omelet. The eggs were fluffy and he didn\\'t skimp on the ingredients. The waffles were to die for and the gravy for the biscuits was very tasty. I didn\\'t care much for the potatoes or bacon/sausage but overall it was a very good meal for $14.95 per person  ($6.99 for kids) but the service was just ok. Like I said, we had a great waitress and the omelet guy was friendly, but the greeters, the ladies serving coffee at the front desk and the rest of the wait staff didn\\'t seem to want any part of customers. We may try this again because I love a good, tasty breakfast buffet, but with other options it won\\'t be our go-to place. Yet.',\n",

As for the menu, it was pretty basic next to the restaurants we've been going to lately. Sometimes that's exactly what you need. I had the sweet and savory platter with scrambled eggs, sausage, and plain buttermilk pancakes. Very good and satisfied my breakfast craving.\\nI did find the fact that they have breakfast sandwiches pretty unique and even though I didn't get one personally, I heard the Jo Jo was delightful. \\n\\nNow for the stuff I didn't care for...\\nThere was a guy doing construction work near the bathroom the whole time we were there. So instead of a music ambiance, we had power tools. Why they scheduled that during business hours is beyond me and if I hadn't had a six person party coming from all different directions to get together, I would have left. It's really distracting trying to talk to people when that's going on.\\nAlso the tea I had wasn't very good. I realize it's not their fault when all they have is bagged tea but I do appreciate a larger selection if that's what you're going to serve.\\n\\nThe food and service was ok, nothing to write home about but definitely good for the plain breakfast mood when you're sick of Bob Evans. Honestly, there could have been a very good reason for the construction work even though they didn't bother to explain. It could have been an off day and I wouldn't mind giving this place a second chance in the future.\",\n",

Is it a restaurant (the place is packed on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch, and they offer full menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner), a bakery (the windows case is packed with cakes, cookies, and other bakery delights), or a cafe (a variety of coffee drinks are available)? \\n\\nThe thing is, I guess that\\'s where Perk-Cup falls a little short for me; it seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. In fairness, I have only been there (albeit on a number of different occasions) for breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday, and I have never opted for the brunch buffet, electing rather to order off their menu. \\n\\nThe food is always really good. Fresh eggs, fresh ingredients, and some of the best pancakes you\\'ve had in a very long time unless you\\'re making them yourself; yes they\\'re that good. \\n\\nThe service is ok. They\\'re generally nice enough but there also seems to be a systemic problem somewhere behind the scenes, as it always feels as though you are on the cusp of utter chaos, like they\\'re just barely hanging on. It\\'s just a bit disorganized and it makes one feel a bit uneasy. \\n\\nOn the coffee side of the house, let\\'s just say you\\'ve had better coffee at a lesser place I\\'m sure. I\\'d either take the \"Cafe\" out of the name, or find a new coffee vendor and/or barista. It\\'s not horrible mind you, but it\\'s not anything to write home about either. \\n\\nThe bakery case is always full of sweet treats, although I question their freshness. I\\'ve never actually eaten any of there bakery items, and they all look really good, but I wonder how long a quarter of a cake could have been sitting there when I come in on a Saturday or Sunday morning. How quickly could they have sold 3/4 of a cake by 9 am? See what I mean? But again, in fairness, I\\'ve never actually tried anything from their bakery so I may be way off. \\n\\nLike I said, I\\'ve been to Perk-Cup a number of times for breakfast, and I will go a number more times.

       "   'text': 'Have been a patron at this restaurant since it opened, and recently have become unimpressed with the current establishment. Don\\'t get me wrong- the food is great and one of the best breakfast/brunch/lunch spots in Berea. Have never had a bad meal here and probably never will. However, the service has deteriorated over the years. When it first opened, my mother and I used to go there for breakfast on the weekend and could get in and out in 45 minutes. Now, we\\'re lucky if we get in and out in a hour and half to two hours. Our drink orders always come right away but we end up waiting at least a half hour for our food. In fact, attempted to eat lunch there today and today\\'s experience took the cake for bad service. There was a party going on in the back room, but our waitress did not notify us of this fact until she came back 35 minutes after we ordered to apologize for slow service because of the party. We then asked her how much longer it would be and when she told us we would STILL have to wait another 10 to 15 minutes, we left. A party should not slow service down to that extreme, and if it does the owners should reevaluate how the kitchen runs because obviously something is amiss. Even the half hour wait on a slow day is an indicator that something needs to be done to improve efficiency.\\n\\nDisregarding service, the food my mother and I have eaten here over the years has always been great. For breakfast, I usually get \"The Berea\" with scrambled eggs, bacon, and a biscuit and she either orders that or pancakes. Their \"Turkey, Bacon, Cheddar\" wrap is also an excellent option for lunch. I really do love the food here and that\\'s why I was very upset when my mother and I had but no choice to leave without food today because the service was so poor. Overall, if you order take-out you do not wait nearly as long for the food, so if in the area and you want to experience the fantastic breakfast offered by Perk-cUp, I suggest ordering it to-go to save yourself the service headache. Food is deserving of all 5 stars, but their service is only deserving of 1. Great eats, but make sure to get it to-go.',\n",

       "   'text': \"Stopped for our first time visit to cafe. We went for breakfast and liked that it was a really bright and clean cafe.  The prices were reasonable for breakfast.  $5.99 sausage gravy and biscuits. $1.29 for two eggs added on.  $7.98 for 2 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon and 2 eggs. Husband's sausage gravy tasted homemade with lots of sausage chunks.  Bacon was crispy as requested.  Only food complaint was the pancakes.  They were so tough that it was hard to cut them.  When I brought it to the servers attention, she told me that was how they make them, that their pancakes are dense, not fluffy.  When I said that I could barely cut them, she offered to have them make another batch and they could try cooking them less time.  The replacements were a little better but still pretty tough. (Note to cafe:  maybe the pancake batter needs refreshed with baking powder or stirred less?  This should result in a better pancake.)  I opted for the blackberry topping over the Mrs. Butterworth's syrup.  Great choice, topping had lots of blackberries.  Now for my Tea Rant:  Hot tea drinkers will get this.  Two things ruin a hot tea experience.  First is contaminated water.  Water is contaminated when they use containers that previously held coffee, resulting in coffee tasting tea. Perk-cUp Cafe does NOT have contaminated tea water, but they hit on my other hot tea nerve.  The second is tea refills.  We were charged the same price for both coffee and tea, $1.89 each.  Husband got his hot coffee and even a refill pot was placed on the table for his convenience.  I got a tea bag and carafe of hot water.  When server offered a refill, she wanted to charge me another $1.89 for a second tea bag. What? Husband gets a whole pot of coffee on the table? Coffee is way more expensive than tea.  Anyway, she did give me a 2nd tea bag, this time, only because I had a problem with the pancakes.  (another note to cafe:  Rethink the policy of charging for a 2nd tea bag.  Do you charge for refills on pop or iced tea?)  End Rant.\\nI like supporting locally owned restaurants and will most likely return for lunch sometime.  The menu offered many different sandwiches, salads, and soups.  If I went for breakfast though, I would skip the pancakes.\",\n",

Each time I'm a bit amazed at how good the food really is for a small town place tucked in near the train tracks.\\n\\nI went a la carte on my last visit and ordered a pancake, sausage patties, hash browns, and a side of fruit. I figured they would all be super small side portions, but boy was I wrong. They were very generous with the plating and I couldn't finish all of my food. \\n\\nThe pancake was delicious and looked so tempting that my friend had to sneak a taste too and agreed. It was a fluffy disc the size of a large plate with a dollop of whipped butter on the top. It's probably a dish you can recall from memory of a past experience, but this pancake still exceeded my expectations. The maple syrup mixed in with the melted butter to create a wonderful balance of decadent sweetness.\\n\\nIf you're looking to order a dish straight off the menu, I would recommend the Spanish Omelette. Cheesy eggs and meat together with a little bit of spice. What's not to love? A note to spice wimps that the dish is not too hot on the scale. \\n\\nLet there be a warning that service is fairly slow here. If you're someone that often needs a refill of coffee or water, this probably isn't the place for you. \\n\\nMost servers are friendly at least, but one of the women that runs food orders is not only not helpful, but is rude and dismissive. I tried to politely ask about the side of fruit that I ordered and was missing from the table, and she rudely said the other woman would bring it and walked away. My server then came out, but there was still no side of fruit. I had to kindly ask again for my order. My server quickly fixed this issue, but the other woman had the first opportunity to correct the order and dismissed me. \\n\\nAll in all, I deducted a star for service, but it's a place I'd go to again if I was in the area. At least I know that I'll get a pretty good meal if nothing else.\",\n",

One of the girls (who was coming with her baby) literally lived right around the corner and our plan was to head to Great Northern after so we decided to check this place out and boy were we glad we did! \\n\\nDoesn't look like much on the outside, but he place is adorable. It has a bunch of tables with waiter service and then has some couches with a double fireplace where you can catch up with friends and just have coffee if you're not looking for anything sit-down. The decor is super cute, too. Very coffee-shop-esque. \\n\\nFor being a Wednesday morning, there were definitely a lot of tables full of people. We started off with some coffee, which was good. The breakfast menu is pretty big!! It was so hard to decide what to get, but I settled on a breakfast bake that had artichokes, tomatoes, spinach, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and cheese. It was delicious! It was baked in a ramekin so it stayed steaming hot during my entire meal which was nice. I got a biscuit instead of the toast. The biscuit was ok, a bit dry and could have used some more salt. My friends enjoyed their meals, as well.\\n\\nThe waitress was super friendly and came by often to refill coffee or make sure we didn't need anything else. Another employee (manager?) kept coming by as well, which was nice in the beginning but began to get pretty annoying. She kept interrupting conversation to talk to us about the baby or her childbirth experience.... we do NOT want to hear that during our meal. And like I said, while it was fine the first few times, the number of times she came over was just a bit much.\\n\\nOverall, the food was great, the prices were very reasonable (9 dollars for my meal? I can def do that... she didn't charge us for any of our coffee which was nice), and the service was good. I will def come back here. \\n\\nPS for those who live nearby, they have a drive thru if you prefer to grab your coffee and go!\",\n",

The staff was very accommodating (I had a baby in tow), offering to carry my diaper bag to table and holding the doors for me as I left.  The only thing keeping this from a 5, is the wait was longer than I would tolerate which is a result from a high demand for tables that they just don't have.  Hopefully, this is just a growing pain. Nonetheless, I will be back and recommend this to anyone entertaining the idea of trying out.\",\n",

The place is nice inside, pretty typical for a modern coffee shop - comfy seats made for chillin, local art on the walls, double fireplace. Good for the college kids. \\nWe had breakfast, starting with a ghiradelli hot chocolate w whipped cream and I asked for mint. It came out fairly quickly, wasn't too hot, ready to drink right away, and was okay - coulda been richer. \\nMy parents got the French toast w bourbon peaches and I got the sweet and savory w chocolate chip pancakes. The food took a pretty long time to make considering it was empty and breakfast food, but it was solid. Nothing special, but well made.

The menu is diverse, with breakfast, sandwiches, wraps, through dinner entrées including a braised short rib dinner. Again, not coffee house selections by any stretch of the imagination.  There were 4 of us dining this evening, and we all had something different, so we got a nice cross section of samples. All of the food was excellent! I had the bbq ribs with the Dr. Pepper  bbq sauce, and they were great.  Tasty, and fall of the bone tender. My wife had chicken parm, which was juicy and very flavorful. My friend had the Pork chop dinner, with an apricot chutney served with risotto. The chop was juicy, and the risotto was perfect, which is rare for most restaurants.  The side dishes were perfect, i had green beans almondine, and they were prepared perfect. Not just green beans with almonds on them, but actually prepared like a fine dining restaurant would with toasted almonds and sautéed beans. I was impressed. This was my first visit, but our friends have been there several times and have raved about the food each time. The atmosphere is simple and un-assuming, very casual, and family friendly.  Because of the high quality of the food, I consider this place an excellent value. (Braised short rib dinner for under  $18!)  Everything is homemade, and fresh, and you can really taste the difference. Oh, the deserts were equally as good!

Even when it's busy it never feels too crowded. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is the customer service has always been very slow no matter how busy it had been.

       "   'text': \"Many friends have raved about Perk Cup Cafe & Grille and I finally had a chance to go there and it was terrific.  I had one of their overstuffed omelettes (called Healthy One, which was stuffed with fresh and delicious baby spinach, tomato, mushroom, green pepper, artichoke hearts, and onion.  I did not add cheese but it was an option). Yummy.  I had the choice of home fries or fresh tomato slices as my side.  I chose the tomato and were they ever flavorful.  I think they came out of a garden instead of through a store.  I also had the choice of toast, bagel or English muffin.  I chose the English muffin which was fat and delicious.  We added a side of fresh fruit:  strawberries, pineapple and cantelope which were all perfectly ripened and delicious.  I chose to have their flavored coffee and I loved it!  My friend had a beautiful salad and a cup of their homemade chicken soup, and was very pleased with the quality of ingredients and flavors.  Our food was superior.  The restaurant itself is newly built, very clean and features walls of art by various local artists which can be purchased.  It's a lovely environment.\\n\\nNow, I did read the Yelp reviews posted on this site before I went.  Because I have heard so many positive comments from friends about Perk Cup Cafe I decided that we would give it a try.  Our experience was nothing like the reviews I read.  There were plenty of busy and friendly waitresses.  The place was nearly full with lots of chatter from young to old.  People were enjoying themselves.  Our waitress, Sheena, told me that the negative Yelp reviews resulted in the departure of certain employees and replaced with customer service oriented people.\\n\\nBottom line is that Perk Cup Cafe is doing a really good job.  Everything that you would want in a local establishment is top notch here.  I'm happy for the city of Berea that their town can offer such a nice establishment.\\n\\nP.S.  I have been told that their weekend brunch is a must try.  We will be going!\",\n",

       "   'text': \"I must say that this place is the first restaurant recommended to us by a voice synthesized computer (we asked 'Siri', the artificial intelligence voice resident on our iPhone 5, to recommend some breakfast places {they serve lunch/dinner too}, and one of the places 'she' mentioned was Perk-Cup Cafe)!  We definitely 'owe her one'!  We were looking for a new place to try for breakfast, and let me tell you, this excellent cafe/restaurant does NOT dissapoint!   Breakfast (which is served all day) choices are plentiful, and my wife was thrilled with her delicious 'Miss Vicki' breakfast bake, which is a combination of layered sun dried tomato pesto, provolone, italian sausage, hash browns, and scrambled eggs.  I had a cheddar cheese omelet with red onions (with rye toast), and a pancake side.  Both were scrumptious!  The interior is very nice and modern, with a huge 'open air' layout that looks like a combination diner / hip cafe, complete with fireplace, armchairs lounge area, high chairs and a long bar table lining the windows, and conventional dining tables and booths.  And a pastry counter to test your will-power on the way in or out!  VERY nice!  On a side note, the restrooms are immaculate clean, and they even have a drive-thru pickup window too, as well as free Wi-Fi!  The staff is very professional and friendly too.  My only regret is that we didn't discover this gem sooner!  Needless to say, HIGHLY recommended!\",\n",
